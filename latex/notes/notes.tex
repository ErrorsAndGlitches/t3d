\ssn{Super Block Rotation: 24 March 2013}

Because the blocks of the super block must be aligned on unit intervals, this
imposes a constraint that sometimes does not allow the center of mass to be
used as a rotation point.  The rotation points chosen are close to the center
of mass and in some instances are more natural than using the center of mass
when rotation the super block during game play. Figure \ref{fig:superBlocks-2}
shows the new axes of rotation used in the game.

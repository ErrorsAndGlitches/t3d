\sn{Overview: 10 April 2013}

The members of team are Zach Palchick and Benjamyn Ward, whom are implementing
a three dimensional tetris game called \tb{T3D}. 

The game consists of two players whom are trying to cause their opponent's
block height to reach the maximum block height, thereby loosing. See figure
\ref{fig:screen}. Players can use the mouse to rotate the main view. Tetris
blocks can be moved and rotated using the keyboard.

Zach is using a Windows environment to develop the game while Benjamyn is using
a Linux environment. We are using
\href{http://industriousone.com/premake}{Premake 4} to build configuration
files from the source code. Thus a single configuration file can be used to
build the Visual Studio project file in the Windows environment and the GNU
Makefile for the Linux environment. We are hosting the code in a private git
repository on \href{http://bitbucket.org}{Bitbucket}.

We will be using SDL to import textures and audio. The graphics back-end will
be OpenGL.

We've already had a few meetings and created some documentation that can be
found in the next sections of this document. Instead of retyping everything,
you can just skim through to see our discussion and conclusions.
